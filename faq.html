    <div><h1 id="faq"><a href="#faq" class="anchor"></a>FAQ</h1><h2 id="general"><a href="#general" class="anchor"></a>General</h2><h3 id="who-is-behind-the-project-"><a href="#who-is-behind-the-project-" class="anchor"></a>Who is behind the project?</h3><p>Code for Science and Society (CSS), a US based 501(c)(3) not for profit organization set up to support the Dat project. CSS employs a Dat core development team. Dat is currently funded exclusively by philanthropic non-profit grants. The mission of CSS is to work with public institutions to produce open source infrastructure to improve the ability for researchers, civic hackers and journalists to find and use datasets. However, we actively welcome outside contributors and use cases beyond our own.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-dat-peers-discover-one-another-on-the-internet-"><a href="#how-do-dat-peers-discover-one-another-on-the-internet-" class="anchor"></a>How do Dat peers discover one another on the Internet?</h3><p>Dat is very flexible. It currently uses 3 methods, and you can implement your own.</p>
<p> 1) Multicast udp, which lets it work over the local network (LAN),
 2) A distributed hash table, which lets it work without a central server, and
 3) Centralized signaling servers that run a modified version of DNS.</p>
<p>We run a signaling server for users of our client applications. However, anyone can run a signaling server and can overwrite the default for their application.</p>
<h3 id="are-the-dat-links-guaranteed-to-be-unique-"><a href="#are-the-dat-links-guaranteed-to-be-unique-" class="anchor"></a>Are the Dat links guaranteed to be unique?</h3><p>It&#39;s not technically impossible that they&#39;d collide, but it&#39;s extremely unlikely. Dat links are are 32 bytes long. That&#39;s 1.1579 x 10^77 possible numbers!</p>
<h3 id="how-is-dat-different-than-ipfs-"><a href="#how-is-dat-different-than-ipfs-" class="anchor"></a>How is Dat different than IPFS?</h3><p>IPFS and Dat share a number of underlying similarities but address different problems. Both deduplicate content-addressed pieces of data and have a mechanism for searching for peers who have a specific piece of data. Both have implementations which work in modern Web browsers, as well as command line tools.</p>
<p>The two systems also have a number of differences. Dat keeps a secure version log of changes to a dataset over time which allows Dat to act as a version control tool. The type of Merkle tree used by Dat lets peers compare which pieces of a specific version of a dataset they each have and efficiently exchange the deltas to complete a full sync. It is not possible to synchronize or version a dataset in this way in IPFS without implementing such functionality yourself, as IPFS provides a CDN and/or filesystem interface but not a synchronization mechanism. In short, IPFS provides distribution of objects, Dat provides synchronization of datasets.</p>
<p>In order for IPFS to provide guarantees about interoperability, IPFS applications must use only the IPFS network stack. In contrast, Dat is only an application protocol and is agnostic to which network protocols (transports and naming systems) are used. As a result, Dat cannot make the same types of interoperability guarantees as IPFS.</p>
<h3 id="is-there-a-javascript-or-node-js-implementation-"><a href="#is-there-a-javascript-or-node-js-implementation-" class="anchor"></a>Is there a JavaScript or Node.js implementation?</h3><p>Yes, it is our only implementation. Find it on GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/datproject/dat-node">dat-node</a>.</p>
<h3 id="is-there-an-online-dataset-registry-like-github-"><a href="#is-there-an-online-dataset-registry-like-github-" class="anchor"></a>Is there an online dataset registry, like GitHub?</h3><p>Yes. See <a href="http://github.com/datproject/datfolder">datproject/datfolder</a> on GitHub.</p>
<h3 id="is-there-a-desktop-application-"><a href="#is-there-a-desktop-application-" class="anchor"></a>Is there a desktop application?</h3><p>Yes. See <a href="http://github.com/datproject/dat-desktop">datproject/dat-desktop</a> on GitHub.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-plan-to-have-python-or-r-or-other-third-party-language-integrations-"><a href="#do-you-plan-to-have-python-or-r-or-other-third-party-language-integrations-" class="anchor"></a>Do you plan to have Python or R or other third-party language integrations?</h3><p>Yes. We are currently developing the serialization format (like .zip archives) called <a href="/sleep">SLEEP</a> so that third-party libraries can read data without reimplementing all of hyperdrive (which is node-only).</p>
<h2 id="security-amp-privacy"><a href="#security-amp-privacy" class="anchor"></a>Security &amp; Privacy</h2><h3 id="is-data-shared-over-dat-encrypted-"><a href="#is-data-shared-over-dat-encrypted-" class="anchor"></a>Is data shared over Dat encrypted?</h3><p>Yes, data shared over Dat is encrypted in transit using the public key (Dat link). When you share a Dat, you must share the public key with another user so they can download it. We use that key on both ends to encrypt the data so both users can read the data but we can ensure the data is not transferred over the internet without encryption.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-possible-to-discover-public-keys-via-man-in-the-middle-"><a href="#is-it-possible-to-discover-public-keys-via-man-in-the-middle-" class="anchor"></a>Is it possible to discover public keys via man-in-the-middle?</h3><p>The public key is hashed, creating the discovery key, before we share it over the network. Whenever peers attempt to connect to each other, they use the discovery key. This ensures that the public key is never sent by Dat over the network.</p>
<p>Data is encrypted using the public key, so it is important that this key stays secure.</p>
<h3 id="can-anyone-download-my-data-what-if-i-don-39-t-share-the-key-with-anyone-"><a href="#can-anyone-download-my-data-what-if-i-don-39-t-share-the-key-with-anyone-" class="anchor"></a>Can anyone download my data? What if I don&#39;t share the key with anyone?</h3><p>Only someone with the key can download data for Dat. It is the responsibility of the user that the Dat link is only shared with people who should access the data. The key is never sent over the network via Dat. We do not track keys centrally. It is almost impossible for <a href="http://docs.datproject.org/faq#are-the-dat-links-guaranteed-to-be-unique-">keys to overlap</a> (and thus to guess keys).</p>
<h3 id="how-does-dat-make-sure-i-download-the-correct-content-"><a href="#how-does-dat-make-sure-i-download-the-correct-content-" class="anchor"></a>How does Dat make sure I download the correct content?</h3><p>Dat uses the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree</a> to make sure content is not tampered with. When content is added to a Dat we  cryptographically fingerprint it and add it to the tree. On download, we can use the tree to make sure the content has not changed and the parent hashes match.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-dat-help-to-improve-transparency-"><a href="#how-does-dat-help-to-improve-transparency-" class="anchor"></a>How does Dat help to improve transparency?</h3><p>Dat uses an append-only to track changes over time. An append-only log shows all of the changes for a given Dat since it was shared. We use this for version control but it can also bolster transparency for a dataset. Any changes to a dataset will be tracked and you can see what changed and when.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-and-security-versus-bittorrent"><a href="#privacy-and-security-versus-bittorrent" class="anchor"></a>Privacy and Security Versus Bittorrent</h3><p>As a peer to peer network, Dat faces similar privacy risks as Bittorrent. When you download a dataset, your IP address is exposed to the users sharing that dataset. This may lead to honeypot servers collecting IP addresses, as we&#39;ve seen in Bittorrent. However, with dataset sharing we can create a web of trust model where specific institutions are trusted as primary sources for datasets, diminishing the sharing of IP addresses. <a href="https://datproject.org/blog/2016-12-18-p2p-reader-privacy">Read more</a> about reader privacy in the p2p web.</p>
<h2 id="under-the-hood"><a href="#under-the-hood" class="anchor"></a>Under the Hood</h2><h3 id="is-dat-different-from-hyperdrive-"><a href="#is-dat-different-from-hyperdrive-" class="anchor"></a>Is Dat different from hyperdrive?</h3><p><a href="http://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdrive">Hyperdrive</a> is a file sharing network built for Dat.</p>
<p>Dat uses hyperdrive and a variety of other modules. Hyperdrive and Dat are compatible with each other but hyperdrive is able to make lower-level decisions. Dat presents a user-friendly interface and ecosystem for scientists, researchers, and data analysts.</p>
<h3 id="does-dat-use-webrtc-"><a href="#does-dat-use-webrtc-" class="anchor"></a>Does Dat use WebRTC?</h3><p>Our <a href="http://github.com/datproject/datfolder">datfolder</a> prototype used WebRTC to transfer data between peers. Moving forward, we are not planning on immediately supporting WebRTC in any Dat client because of reliability issues and lack of support in non-browser environments. Our future browser implementations of Dat will use websockets to transfer data to non-browser Dat interfaces.</p>
<h3 id="dat-on-the-cli-isn-39-t-connecting-how-do-i-debug-"><a href="#dat-on-the-cli-isn-39-t-connecting-how-do-i-debug-" class="anchor"></a>Dat on the CLI isn&#39;t connecting, how do I debug?</h3><ol>
<li>Try running <code>dat doctor</code> and following the instructions</li>
<li>Try running your command with <code>DEBUG=discovery*</code> in front, e.g. <code>DEBUG=discovery* dat sync</code></li>
</ol>
<p>When reading debug output, look for <code>inbound connection</code> (means someone else successfully connected to you) or <code>onconnect</code> (you successfully connected to someone else). <code>discovery peer=</code> messages mean you found a candidate and will try to connect to them.</p>
